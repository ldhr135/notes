Little Timmy’s Wish
I encountered Little Timmy again after the school day ended. He approached me with bright decision in his eyes. 
“The internet is a bad place,” said Little Timmy. “They’ll just do what they always do, again. Yell at you until you either walk away or give in to stop the annoyance.” 
“Why do you say that?” I asked, a little annoyed. Little Timmy always talked about this same damn topic. “Why should you concern over it?”
“Oh, I don’t,” he answered with pride in his voice. “I don’t at all. I just like watching the mess.”
I had always admired how intelligent he was for his young age, especially for his handling of words; yet, I felt that habit of getting into places he shouldn’t be in would only harm him in the future. The way I cared about him—I almost felt like his older brother; with the responsibility of teaching a fellow all about the dangers and injustices of life, though I had only known him for two months.
“So you know it’s a bad place, and you still want to watch what goes on in it?”
“It’s dumb but it’s interesting!” he answered. “I just wanna write it all. Every piece of nonsense in it is worthless; but that worthlessness, that’s what makes it priceless. I can’t waste my opportunity! I wish very hard with my whole heart: I just want to understand it all; watch it bloom in saturated colors,” he answered with playful determination and an excited look on his face.
I wondered if he would change his mind about his wish once he was a teenager, like I had; and I wondered if that would be a good decision.
